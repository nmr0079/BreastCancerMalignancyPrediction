# BreastCancerMalignancyPrediction

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict breast cancer malignancy using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset. The dataset consists of various features extracted from digitized images of breast mass, which are used to classify the tumor as malignant or benign.

## Project Highlights

   * Conducted comprehensive data analysis and exploratory data visualization to gain insights into the dataset.
   * Performed data preprocessing and feature engineering techniques to prepare the data for modeling.
   * Employed multiple machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, KNN classifier, and support vector machines, to build predictive models.
   * Evaluated the performance of each model using accuracy and F1-score metrics.
   * Implemented cross-validation techniques to assess the model's generalization ability and handle overfitting.
